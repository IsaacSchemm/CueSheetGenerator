Cue Sheet Generator
===================

This is a Windows application to splits one or more podcasts up into multiple
CD tracks, for playing on a CD player where the rewind / fast-forward
functionality might be lacking.

The option "generate .wav/.cue pair" combines inputs into one .wav file, and
creates a .cue file to burn them to a CD, with track breaks at the end of each
input file and every five minutes between them.

The option "generate multiple .wav files" splits inputs into .wav files of up
to five minutes; these .wav files can then be burned to CD with Windows Media
Player Legacy (with "burn CD without gaps" turned on).
