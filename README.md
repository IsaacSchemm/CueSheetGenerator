Cue Sheet Generator
===================

This is a Windows application that takes one or more audio files (as command
line arguments or via an "open" dialog), combines them into one .wav file, and
creates a .cue file to burn them to a CD, with track breaks at the end of each
input file and every five minutes between them.

It's designed for burning podcasts to a CD, for playing on a CD player where
the rewind / fast-forward functionality might be lacking.
